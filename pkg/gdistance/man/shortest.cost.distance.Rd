\title{ ~~function to do ... ~~ }
\description{
Calculates the shortest cost-distance between points. }
\usage{
shortest.cost.distance(id.xy, transition)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{id.xy}{ point locations (see below) }
  \item{transition}{ transition matrix (defined class) }
}
\details{
Distance is calculated in cost units specified in the distance matrix. \n
id.xy is a matrix with three columns: ID, x, and y.
}
\value{
distance matrix
